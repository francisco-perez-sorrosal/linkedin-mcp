## Implemented

(none)

## Pending

### Async HTTP Scraping Pipeline
- **Status**: Validated (auto-validated, non-interactive)
- **Date**: 2026-02-13
- **Summary**: Replace Selenium + multiprocessing with httpx.AsyncClient + BeautifulSoup for job detail scraping. Eliminates Chrome dependency, reduces memory ~30x, improves throughput 5-10x. Includes cache duplication bug fix, dead code cleanup, and rate limiting.
- **Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)
- **Next**: Systems-architect
- **Proposal**: `.ai-work/IDEA_PROPOSAL.md`

## Candidates (not yet selected)

### Client-Side Job Search Orchestration Skill
- **Summary**: Create a Claude Code skill composing the 3-step manual MCP tool chain (search URL -> get IDs -> get metadata) into a single parameterized command with filtering and ranking.
- **Effort**: Small (hours)
- **Notes**: Independent of server-side changes; can be pursued in parallel.

### Multi-Board Job Aggregation via JobSpy
- **Summary**: Integrate JobSpy library to aggregate jobs from LinkedIn + Indeed + Glassdoor + Google + ZipRecruiter via a new MCP tool with unified data model.
- **Effort**: Medium (days)
- **Notes**: Architecturally bigger; benefits from async pipeline foundation.

### Smart Job Monitoring with TTL-Based Cache
- **Summary**: Add scraped_at timestamp checking, TTL-based re-scraping, and session-persistent "seen" tracking for incremental job discovery.
- **Effort**: Small-Medium
- **Notes**: Should follow cache duplication bug fix (included in async pipeline proposal).

### Job Relevance Scoring and Preference Matching
- **Summary**: Extract structured requirements from job descriptions, score against user preference profile, auto-filter low-relevance jobs.
- **Effort**: Medium-Large
- **Notes**: Highest effort; depends on clean structured data from scraping pipeline.

## Discarded

(none)

## Future Paths

- **Playwright fallback**: If LinkedIn starts requiring JS execution for guest pages, Playwright replaces httpx as the scraping backend (not Selenium). Architecture should allow swapping the fetch layer.
- **Crawl4AI for unstructured pages**: If the project expands beyond LinkedIn's structured guest API to scraping arbitrary pages, Crawl4AI's LLM-ready markdown output is worth evaluating.
- **Google Jobs via SerpAPI/Serper**: Alternative data source that avoids scraping entirely; useful if LinkedIn blocks guest API access.
- **CV tailoring skill migration**: The `tailor_cv` prompt may be better served as a client-side skill with `context: fork` that orchestrates both LinkedIn MCP and CV MCP servers.
